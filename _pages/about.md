`About me`

Hello and welcome! I'm an industrial/mechanical engineer, interested in applying data-driven solution and analytics to improve system processes. I have a strong appetite for learning new skills and harness the power of technology to positively impact society. I'm currently immersed in learning to build AI models and data engineering.

`Education`

I'm currently a PhD `Industrial and Systems Engineering` student at Rutgers University majoring in `system analytics`. Prior, I completed `MS` from same department.

`Teaching Assistant`

• ISE 540:492 - I was a Teaching Assistant for Undergraduate course on Reliability Engineering(Instructor: Prof. Elsayed). I supported undergraduate students in understanding core concepts in reliabiliy such as failure analysis, system reliability and probability models, assisted with assignments, and graded coursework.

• ISE 540:501 Teaching Assistant - Also served as as teaching assistant for graduate course on Applied Optimization course (Instructor: Prof. David Coit). I helped students with linear programming and optimization concepts, evaluated course assignments and projects.
