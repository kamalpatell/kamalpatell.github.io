`About me`

Hello and welcome! I'm an industrial/mechanical engineer, interested in applying data-driven solution and analytics to improving systems processes and manufacturing. I have a strong appetite for learning new skills and technology and harness the power of technology to positively impact society. I am continuously improving my skills in AutoCAD, SolidWorks/Creo, Python, Flexsim, and more and currently immersed in learning and building scalable data science models and data engineering. 

About my education, I'm currently an `Industrial and Systems Engineering` graduate at Rutgers University majoring in `system analytics`. Prior to this, I completed my `MS in Mechanical Engineering` from NYU.
